# Get started

## Frontend

``` bash
cd frontend

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reloading for development at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

## Backend

# FSM (Finite State Machine)

A FSM $;$ consists of a set S, R and Q, where: 

* $S$ is a finite input alphabet,
* $R$ is a finite output alphabet and
* $Q$ is a set of states.

## Input:

* $n$: the number of tests cases

* $|S|$: Length of input alphabet

* $S$: input alphabet separated by spaces

* $|R|$: Length of output alphabet

* $R$: Output alphabet separated by spaces

* $|Q|$: Cardinality of set of states
  
* $Q$: set of states separated by spaces, where the first one is the initial state.

* Transition table of shape $|Q| \times (1 + 2|S|) $, where the first column correspond to the states, and 
  its rows are composed of $| S |$ 2-tuples ($q'$, $r'$), which represent its transitions to the next state $q'$ 
  and output $r'$ given the & s_i & stimulus.

## Ouput:

* $b$, the number of blocks product of the partitioning algorithm.

* For each line, print the states that correspond to each block separated by spaces, the order of blocks or states does not matter
